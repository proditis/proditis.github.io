Hi there, I am Pantelis or most commonly known databus, a unix geek with particular interests in cybersecurity and openbsd.

I am the core developer of echoCTF.RED framework and platform and as such i spend most of my time developing vulnerable scenarios.

One could say that I like to develop the best hackable machines :D
